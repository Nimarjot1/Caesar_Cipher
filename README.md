# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher - Secrets of 58 BC

A modern Java Swing-based GUI application that encrypts and decrypts text using the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption used by Julius Caesar himself. Built with Java and a clean GUI, this project helps visualize classic cryptography in action!

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Encrypt or decrypt any message using a Caesar shift
- 🖥️ User-friendly GUI built with Java Swing
- 🎛️ Custom shift input for full control
- ⚡ Real-time response with encrypted/decrypted text
- 🧠 Great for learning how classic ciphers work
- 📋 Scrollable output for long text entries

---

## 🧩 How It Works

The **Caesar Cipher** shifts each letter in your message by a number of positions in the alphabet.

### Example:
If you enter `HELLO` with a shift of `3`, the output will be `KHOOR`.

- `H` → `K`
- `E` → `H`
- `L` → `O`
- `L` → `O`
- `O` → `R`

💡 **Note:** Non-alphabet characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.) remain unchanged.
